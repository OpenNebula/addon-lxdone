# Description

**LXDoNe** is an addon for OpenNebula to manage **LXD** Containers. It fits in the Virtualization and Monitorization Driver section according to OpenNebula's Architecture. It uses the **pylxd** API for several container tasks. This addon is the continuation of [LXCoNe](https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-lxcone/), an addon for **LXC**. Check the [blog entry](https://opennebula.org/blog/) in OpenNebula official site.

# Introduction

**LXDoNe** is an addon for OpenNebula to manage **LXD** Containers. It fits in the Virtualization and Monitorization Driver section according to OpenNebula's Architecture. It uses the **pylxd** API for several container tasks. This addon is the continuation of [LXCoNe](https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-lxcone/), an addon for **LXC**. Check the [blog entry](https://opennebula.org/lxdone-lightweight-virtualization-for-opennebula/) in OpenNebula official site.

[LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) is a daemon which provides a REST API to drive **LXC** containers. Containers are lightweight OS-level Virtualization instances, they behave like Virtual Machines but don't suffer from hardware emulation processing penalties by sharing the kernel with the host. They run bare-metal-like, simple containers can boot up in 2 seconds consuming less than 32MB of RAM and a minimal fraction of a CPU Core. Check out this [performance comparison against KVM](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/05/18/lxd-crushes-kvm-in-density-and-speed/) if you don't know much about LXD.

# Development & Contribution
If you want to contribute feel free to request new features, the TODO list is stated according to our priority order. Check the [Flowchart](picts/flow_chart) to get a bettter understanding of the driver internals, pictures starting with **one- **    ex. [one-deploy.png](picts/flow_chart/one-deploy.png) ressemble the scripts overview. The action scripts are written in python, there is a script  [lxd_common.py](src/remotes/vmm/lxd/lxd_common.py) containing lots of functions used by the action scripts ex. [lxd_common.py](src/remotes/vmm/lxd/deploy.py) which is executed when starting a VM, tus reducing the code, if you want to add code and it could be used by several action scripts then add it here.

# Compatibility
**LXDoNe** is not an update of **LXCoNe** so your old containers won't be manageable out of the box, but you can  adapt them to the new image format, read [Virtual Appliance](Image.md).
